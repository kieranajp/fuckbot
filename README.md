# @!%#bot

**A Slackbot that tells you off for swearing!**

This bot reads your @!%#ing slack channels for messages containing (configurable) swear words, and if it finds them:

- Posts a message back in the channel to tell the @!%#er off
- Saves the swears to a @!%#ing sqlite database - so we can get metrics later on which @!%#er swears the most!

## Requirements and Installation

Tested on node.js 6.0, any lower and you need to get with the @!%#ing program, or use a @!%#ing transpiler, you @!%#.

Clone this, `npm install`, copy `config.js.dist` to `config.js` and fill in your @!%#ing Slack API token.

`node index.js` to start. (or `node-babel` if you want to transpile it like a @!%#wit)
